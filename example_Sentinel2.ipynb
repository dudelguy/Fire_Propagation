    "# Downloading Sentinel-2 data \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides code on how to download Sentinel-2 data from Google Earth Engine (GEE). This specific example is closely connected to the creation of a fire propagation database. After creating the individual burned area propagation files, Sentinel-2 data is downloaded according to the shape and the geographical position of the burned area images. Nevertheless, the presented code can be used to download Sentinel-2 data for every other shape as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Sentinel-2 data is processed in GEE to create cloud-free composit images, before EEs computePixels function is used to transfer the data from server to client side. To increase the speed of this process, and to enable the download of Sentinel-2 data for large areas, the original shape is divided into a predefined number of equally sized squares. After the download, these squares are combined to reconstruct the original image.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For fire propagation, information from other remote sensing collections is interesting, too. We therefore offer the option to include the Digital Elevation Model (DEM) from the TanDEM-X mission, as well as the Dynamic Land Cover classification to the downloaded Sentine-2 data. "
