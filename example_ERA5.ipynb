    "This notebook illustrates the use of module 'era5_from_ee' to download ERA5 data from Google Earth Engine (GEE). This specific example is closely connected to the creation of a fire propagation database. After creating the individual burned area propagation files, ERA5 data is downloaded according to the shape, time and the geographical position of the burned area images. Nevertheless, the presented code can be used to download ERA5 data for every other shape as well.",

    "ERA5 includes 50 different meteorological variables. For most tasks, not all variables are needed. To avoid unnecessary large data, the necessary variables are specified and extracted in Google Earth Engine, before they are downloaded simultaneously."
